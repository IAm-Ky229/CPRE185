# CPRE 185
This was an introductory C programming course. Solving some simpler problems in C helped to prepare me for the more challenging courses I would be taking in the future. The labs largely revolved around taking sensor readings from a Playstation 4 (DS4) controller.

###### Lab 1
Didn't really do anything in this lab. Just ran the executable that the professor gave us and stored the data in some Microsoft Excel files.

###### Lab 2
Looked at difference between operations regarding floats, doubles, and integers. Also create a program that takes a user input and finds the volume of a 3D prism.

###### Lab 3
Start to work with the sensors on the DS4. Find acceleration of the controller when it is dropped. Also detect how many buttons are currently being pressed.

###### Lab 4
Detemine the orientation of the DS4 controller (up, down, front, right, left, backwards facing) by using the accelerometer and gyroscope sensors.
