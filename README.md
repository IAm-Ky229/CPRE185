# CPRE 185
This was an introductory C programming course. Solving some simpler problems in C helped to prepare me for the more challenging courses I would be taking in the future. The labs largely revolved around taking sensor readings from a Playstation 4 (DS4) controller.

###### Lab 1
Didn't really do anything in this lab. Just ran the executable that the professor gave us and stored the data in some Microsoft Excel files.

###### Lab 2
Looked at difference between operations regarding floats, doubles, and integers. Also create a program that takes a user input and finds the volume of a 3D prism.

###### Lab 3
Start to work with the sensors on the DS4. Find acceleration of the controller when it is dropped. Also detect how many buttons are currently being pressed.

###### Lab 4
Detemine the orientation of the DS4 controller (up, down, front, right, left, backwards facing) by using the accelerometer and gyroscope sensors.

###### Lab 5
Use the speed of gravity to determine how far a controller falls after a certain period of time. Compensate for air resistance to obtain a more accurate fall distance.

###### Lab 6
Use the gyroscope sensors to determine how far the DS4 controller was turned right and left. Print out a user-friendly graph on the screen that shows how far "tilted" the controller is.

###### Lab 7
Take in command line arguments and analyze the "average" values of the gyroscope sensors over a period of time. Create a buffer that continually takes in new gyroscope values to analyze.

###### Lab 8
Create a maze of varying difficulty depending on command line arguments. Use the gyroscope sensors on the DS4 controller to navigate through the maze (tilting left moves left, tilting right moves right, etc).
